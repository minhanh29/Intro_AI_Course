This program creates an AI to solve 4 Knights and Knaves puzzles.

In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the
truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence
is false.
The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is
a knight or a knave.
