Given information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait 
(e.g. hearing loss)caused by a given gene, the AI will infer the probability distribution for each
personâ€™s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait in question.

Open the program by typing this command
python3 heredity.py data/family0.csv  

(change family0 to family1 or family2 to open those data sets)
